Lord Krishna, probably, is one of the best leaders of the world of all the time. In the world, whether you are working for an organization or are doing your own business or even you are professionals or Individual, the most common thing in human beings is that you suffer through lots of human emotions. For Example In an Organization Depressed employees  organization are a common sight. Depressed employees, unmotivated employees, dejected employees, hopeless employees are very harmful to any organization as they not only decrease the productivity but they also create an atmosphere in which other colleagues may also feel De-motivated and depressed. Similarly if someone runs his/her own business and remains depressed while doing work, certainly he/she will not achieve that much in his/her business if he/she would have been highly motivated & energetic. Now, Anger, Confusion, Envy, Losing Hope, Lust, De-motivation, Depression, Loneliness etc. all these human emotions  relate to one’s mind or relate to one’s mental position. It's only the Mind that gets affected by these Emotions. In this Web Project we have worked on menu based web page to provide effective solution regarding state of mind through Shrimad Bhagwat Gita. Teachings of Shrimad Bhagwat Gita as told by Lord Sri Krishna Himself to Arjuna as a <b>Message To the World</b>. These teachings are as much relevant in fast day to day life of ours today as these were in ancient times.</p><br>
