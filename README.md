Idea Behind This Project (Background

In the world, whether you are working for an organization or are doing your own business or even you are professionals or Individual, the most common thing in human beings is that you suffer through lots of human emotions. For Example In an Organization Depressed employees  organization are a common sight. Depressed employees, unmotivated employees, dejected employees, hopeless employees are very harmful to any organization as they not only decrease the productivity but they also create an atmosphere in which other colleagues may also feel De-motivated and depressed. Similarly if someone runs his/her own business and remains depressed while doing work, certainly he/she will not achieve that much in his/her business if he/she would have been highly motivated & energetic. Now, Anger, Confusion, Envy, Losing Hope, Lust, De-motivation, Depression, Dejection, Loneliness all these human emotions  relate to one’s mind or relate to one’s mental position.
